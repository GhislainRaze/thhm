# Two-harmonic homotopy method

## Description

This repository contains Matlab code for minimal working examples using the two-harmonic homotopy method to uncover isolated secondary resonances.

A basic pseudoarclength continuation procedure is given in simpleContinuation.m. It may require fine tuning, and for a more advanced use, a more robust continuation code/toolbox is recommended.
